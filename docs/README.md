# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for delivering high-quality projects through clear processes, defined roles, and transparent communication.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to ensure consistent, high-quality delivery through clear roles, structured workflows, and transparent communication. The lifecycle begins with project initiation, where the business need is validated, stakeholders are aligned, and success metrics are defined. Key artifacts, such as the Project One-pager and Risk Register, are created early on to provide clarity and focus. Once approved, initiatives move into planning, where work is broken into actionable increments, dependencies are mapped, and release timelines are established. This phase emphasizes kickoffs, backlog creation with acceptance criteria, and the documentation of the Definition of Done.

The team operates with well-defined personas: Project Managers coordinate delivery, manage risks, and facilitate communication; Product Managers prioritize the backlog, own the product vision, and measure outcomes; Developers implement features, maintain code quality, and participate in reviews; Stakeholders provide input and approvals. These roles interact within a cadence of daily standups, weekly syncs, and regular demos, ensuring alignment and rapid escalation of blockers when needed. OctoAcme maintains a strong emphasis on psychological safety and iterative delivery, encouraging feedback and continuous improvement through retrospectives after each sprint or milestone.

Execution is tracked using tools like GitHub Projects, with explicit workflows for pull requests, quality assurance, and risk management. Small PRs, automated CI checks, and mandatory code reviews are standard, complemented by unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The team also monitors velocity, success metrics, and key signals via dashboards, and updates the risk register weekly. Blockers are escalated in a structured manner, starting from team triage to sponsor-level intervention for critical issues.

Communication is a cornerstone of OctoAcme's approach, with weekly syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and clear templates for status and incident reporting. Stakeholder communication is proactive and documented, using single sources of truth and regular updates. Continuous improvement is embedded in the culture, with action items tracked and reviewed, and learnings celebrated. Together, these practices foster a transparent, repeatable, and collaborative environment, minimizing risks and accelerating onboarding for new team members.
