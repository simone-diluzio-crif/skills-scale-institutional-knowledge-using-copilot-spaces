# OctoAcme — Role Boundaries & Cross-Functional Collaboration

## Purpose
Clarify role boundaries, decision-making authority, and collaboration patterns to reduce ambiguity, prevent overlap, and ensure efficient cross-functional teamwork.

---

## Core Principles

### Clear Ownership
- Each role has distinct areas of ownership and decision-making authority
- When ownership overlaps, explicit agreement on the DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) is required
- Accountability is clear, but collaboration is encouraged

### Respectful Collaboration
- Roles should partner, not compete
- Seek input from subject matter experts before making decisions that impact their domain
- Escalate disagreements constructively and transparently

### Continuous Improvement
- Role boundaries may evolve as the organization matures
- Retrospectives should surface boundary issues and process gaps
- Documentation is updated to reflect changes

## Role Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Product Manager | Project Manager | Developer | UX Designer | DevOps Engineer | Business Analyst | QA Lead | Stakeholder |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Product Vision & Roadmap** | Owner | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Inform | Approve |
| **Feature Prioritization** | Owner | Consult | Consult | Consult | Inform | Consult | Inform | Approve |
| **Technical Architecture** | Consult | Inform | Owner | Inform | Owner | Inform | Consult | Inform |
| **Design & UX** | Consult | Inform | Consult | Owner | Inform | Consult | Consult | Approve |
| **Project Timeline & Milestones** | Consult | Owner | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Approve |
| **Risk Management** | Consult | Owner | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Inform |
| **Deployment Strategy** | Inform | Consult | Consult | Inform | Owner | Inform | Consult | Inform |
| **Quality Standards** | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Consult | Owner | Approve |
| **Business Requirements** | Consult | Consult | Inform | Inform | Inform | Owner | Consult | Approve |
| **Budget & Resource Allocation** | Consult | Consult | Inform | Inform | Inform | Inform | Inform | Owner |

**Legend:**
- **Owner**: Makes the final decision and is accountable for the outcome
- **Approve**: Has veto power; must sign off on the decision
- **Consult**: Must be consulted before a decision is made; their input is considered
- **Inform**: Must be informed after a decision is made

## Common Collaboration Patterns

### Feature Development Lifecycle

1. **Ideation & Requirements** (Product Manager + Business Analyst + Stakeholders)
   - Product Manager defines the problem and success metrics
   - Business Analyst gathers detailed business requirements
   - Stakeholders approve strategic fit and budget

2. **Design** (UX Designer + Product Manager + Developer)
   - UX Designer creates mockups and user flows
   - Product Manager validates alignment with user needs
   - Developer provides feedback on technical feasibility

3. **Planning** (Project Manager + Developer + QA Lead + DevOps Engineer)
   - Project Manager coordinates timeline and resources
   - Developer provides estimates and identifies dependencies
   - QA Lead defines test approach
   - DevOps Engineer confirms infrastructure readiness

4. **Implementation** (Developer + UX Designer + QA Lead)
   - Developer implements features according to acceptance criteria
   - UX Designer reviews implementation for design fidelity
   - QA Lead conducts testing and validates quality

5. **Deployment** (DevOps Engineer + Project Manager + QA Lead)
   - DevOps Engineer executes deployment
   - Project Manager coordinates communication and timing
   - QA Lead confirms smoke tests pass

6. **Validation & Retrospective** (Product Manager + Project Manager + Team)
   - Product Manager measures success metrics and customer feedback
   - Project Manager facilitates retrospective
   - Team identifies improvements for next iteration

## Escalation & Conflict Resolution

### When Boundaries Are Unclear
1. **Clarify in real-time**: If unsure who should make a decision, ask explicitly in the meeting or discussion
2. **Document the decision**: Update this guide or relevant project documentation to prevent future confusion
3. **Escalate if needed**: If the team cannot agree, escalate to managers or stakeholders

### Resolving Role Conflicts
1. **Direct discussion**: The two individuals involved should discuss the issue directly first
2. **Manager mediation**: If unresolved, involve direct managers to facilitate
3. **Executive escalation**: For strategic or persistent conflicts, escalate to executive leadership

### Signs of Boundary Issues
- Repeated confusion over who should make a decision
- Duplicate work or missed work due to unclear ownership
- Frustration or tension between roles
- Delays caused by unclear approval paths

**Action**: Surface boundary issues in retrospectives and update documentation promptly.

## Best Practices for Cross-Functional Collaboration

### Do:
- ✅ Respect each role's domain of expertise
- ✅ Seek input from relevant roles early and often
- ✅ Communicate decisions and rationale transparently
- ✅ Escalate blockers quickly and constructively
- ✅ Document decisions and share broadly
- ✅ Assume positive intent and practice psychological safety

### Don't:
- ❌ Make unilateral decisions that impact other roles without consultation
- ❌ Bypass established processes or decision-making authority
- ❌ Withhold information that others need to do their job
- ❌ Blame individuals for systemic issues
- ❌ Let conflicts fester without addressing them

## Continuous Improvement

This document should be treated as a living guide. Teams should:
- Review role boundaries during onboarding and retrospectives
- Update this guide when new roles are added or processes change
- Surface and resolve boundary issues proactively
- Celebrate examples of excellent cross-functional collaboration
